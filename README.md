## Project Overview
This project is written in Haskell and consists of two main parts.

## Part 1: Assembly Language Interpreter
In this part, the program provides an interpreter for a simple assembly language. The assembly language includes basic arithmetic and logical operations, control flow instructions such as conditional statements and loops, and the ability to manipulate a stack and variables.

### Key Definitions
Inst: Data type representing assembly language instructions.
Code: Type alias for a list of assembly instructions.
Stack: Type alias for a stack of integers.
State: Type alias for a list of variable-value pairs.
### Functions
run: Executes a given assembly code, stack, and state, producing a new code, stack, and state.
performBinaryOperation: Helper function to perform binary operations on the stack.
lookupVar, lookupVarBool: Helper functions to look up variables in the state.
updateVar: Helper function to update a variable in the state.
store: Helper function to store a variable in the state.
testAssembler: Function to test the assembler with predefined code examples.
### Example Usage
haskell
Copy code
-- Example 1: Arithmetic operations
testAssembler [Push 10, Push 4, Push 3, Sub, Mult]  -- Output: ("-10","")

-- Example 2: Conditional statements and variable manipulation
testAssembler [Fals, Push 3, Tru, Store "var", Store "a", Store "someVar"]
-- Output: ("","a=3,someVar=False,var=True")
## Part 2: Simple Imperative Language Compiler
This part involves defining types and functions for a simple imperative language. The language includes arithmetic expressions, boolean expressions, and statements such as assignment, sequence, conditional statements, and loops.

### Key Definitions
Aexp: Data type representing arithmetic expressions.
Bexp: Data type representing boolean expressions.
Stm: Data type representing statements.
### Functions
compA: Compiles an arithmetic expression into assembly code.
compB: Compiles a boolean expression into assembly code.
compile: Compiles a list of statements into assembly code.
### Example Usage
haskell
Copy code
-- Example: Compile and run a simple program
testParser "x := 5; x := x - 1;"
-- Output: ("","x=4")
## Strategy
### Part 1
Defined data types (Inst, Code, Stack, State) to represent the assembly language components.
Implemented functions for basic operations (arithmetic, logical) and control flow.
Created helper functions for stack and variable manipulation.
Tested the assembler with predefined examples.
### Part 2
Defined data types (Aexp, Bexp, Stm) to represent the imperative language components.
Implemented functions to compile arithmetic and boolean expressions.
Developed a compiler function to translate a list of statements into assembly code.
Tested the compiler with predefined examples.
## Conclusion
The project provides a comprehensive solution for interpreting a simple assembly language and compiling a basic imperative language into assembly code. The defined data types and functions facilitate code organization and readability. The examples demonstrate the correctness and functionality of the implemented interpreter and compiler.
